## What is an accelerator?

At Blues we are making wireless IoT easier for developers and more affordable for all. This collection of app accelerators is intended to help you get new Notecard- and Notehub-powered projects up and running quickly.

Each accelerator:

* 📚 **Provides a complete walkthrough.**
  * By following the writeups you can recreate each accelerator in its entirety.
* ⚙️ **Includes a full list of the hardware you need.**
  * We link to specific sensors and boards so you know exactly what to get.
* 👨‍💻👩‍💻 **Uses open-source firmware.**
  * We provide the firmware as well as instructions for running it on your devices.
* 📱 **Provides a way of viewing your device data.**
  * We show you how to get the data to a useful place to view, which sometimes is a web dashboard, and sometimes is SMS alerts.
* 📘 **Is free to copy, fork, and build upon.**
  * This repository uses the Apache 2.0 license, which means each accelerator is free for personal and commercial use.
