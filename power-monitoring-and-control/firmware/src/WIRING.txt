*** Notecarrier-F Specific

Add the Swan to the Notecarrier-F.

Make sure that
1. The DFU switch is ON, which maps AUX RX/TX over to F_TX/F_RX for our use of card.aux.serial
2. The SWITCHED switch should be set to ON
3. IF you are connecting this to a DigitalLoggers (DLI) Power Control device, connect + to the F_D10 pad and - to GND

*** Before doing anything, the Dr. Wattson board requires that its I2C address be specified, soldering as follows:

With the board laid out with the pins pointing at you, A1/SJ1 is left (toward inside of board) and A0/SJ2 is right (toward right edge of board).

When soldering to add a solder bridge, the LEFT PAIR SOLDERED is HIGH and RIGHT PAIR SOLDERED is LOW.

0x74  SJ1/A1  LOW, SJ2/A0 LOW
0x75  SJ1/A1  LOW, SJ2/A0 HIGH
0x76  SJ1/A1 HIGH, SJ2/A0 LOW
0x77  SJ1/A1 HIGH, SJ2/A0 HIGH

Note that the firmware works with any address as it dynamically senses 'what's out there'.

*** If you just want to use I2C and nothing else ***

1. buy this: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4397
2. with the pcb laid out with the 8 pins pointing at you, connect that cable as:
BLACK  RED  NC  NC  NC  NC  BLUE  YELLOW

That's all you need to wire, and you can connect it to either the Notecarrier-F's QWIICs or the Swan's QWIIC.  I have verified that the Swan/Notecarrier-F supplies sufficient current to power four units.

In order to mux them, you can use either:

*** If you are using Notecarrier-F and want to test all signals (for example, if using Dr. Wattson's examples),

With the PCB laid out with the 8 pins pointing at you,
GND to Notecarrier-F Pin GND
3.3v (power) to Notecarrier-F Pin F_3V3
Vin (logic level power) to Notecarrier-F Pin N_VIO
GND to Notecarrier-F Pin  GND
Event to Notecarrier-F Pin F_D6
ZCD to Notecarrier-F Pin F_D5
SDA to Notecarrier-F Pin F_SDA
SCL to Notecarrier-F Pin F_SCL
