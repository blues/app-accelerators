1. You will need the drwattson Arduino library
a) Download the ZIP (under the Code button) from http://github.com/upbeatlabs/drwattson
b) Unzip it to your desktop
c) Use the Arduino Sketch / Include Library / Add .ZIP Library option to add the folder "drwattson-master/Arduino/UpbeatLabs_MCP39F521" to the project

2. Arduino has a very limited Serial input buffer, which means that if a developer wishes to use the serial port in a way that receives a large volume of data quickly, the data will be truncated.

The workaround, which is required by this sketch, is to add a compiler flag that increases the serial buffer size.

The first thing you must do is to find the location of the "platform.txt" for the board that you are building for.

For Swan, which is supported by STM32Duino, this is generally located at:
	Mac
		~/Library/Arduino15/packages/STMicroelectronics/hardware/stm32/2.3.0
	Windows
		%HOME$/AppData/Local/Arduino15/packages/STMicroelectronics/hardware/stm32/2.3.0

Create a file in that directory called "platform.local.txt" that has this line within it:

compiler.cpp.extra_flags=-DSERIAL_RX_BUFFER_SIZE=4096

This will increase the RX buffer size to what you need for this sketch.

When using PlatformIO the `SERIAL_RX_BUFFER_SIZE` define is already present in the platformio.ini file in this project.
