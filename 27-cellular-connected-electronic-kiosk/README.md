# Cellular-Connected Electronic Kiosk

A cellular-based solution for downloading resources for an electronic kiosk display with no Internet connection required.

This project is designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi computer with no Internet connection via a Python script. In an effort to keep the required download as small as possible, please see this [separate repository](https://github.com/blues/accelerators-cellular-connected-electronic-kiosk) for full details on building a Cellular-Connected Electronic Kiosk project.
