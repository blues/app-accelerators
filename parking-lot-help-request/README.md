## Hardware

The following hardware is required to run the Parking Lot Help Request application.



## Firmware

Although this is a "host-free" project because the Notecard itself can be configured to send notes to Notehub when the help button is pressed, the Notecard still needs to be set up to do so.

To properly configure the Notecard and format the JSON data sent to Notehub to successfully be delivered to Twilio for SMS alerts, refer to the [`README.md`](firmware/README.md) file in this project's `firmware` folder for full instructions.
