// Do not assume you can reach every gateway, node, sensor, or reading starting
// from an object you're looking at. A QueryFilter is probably in effect which
// has limited the extent to which we have populated objects into memory. For
// example, if you're working with recent data from the 'Black Pearl' node you
// might have info about the Gateway, but just the said node and a few days of
// readings. You'll find `undefined` at the points in the tree that we don't
// care about in the context of an active QueryFilter.

// The convention is that fields that are entirely optional (and may be absent) are
// marked with ?.  Fields that may have undefined values (e.g. no name set) can also be null.
