# note-c

The note-arduino Arduino library for communicating with the
[Blues Wireless][blues] Notecard via serial or IÂ²C.

This library allows you to control a Notecard by writing a C
or C++ program. Your program may programmatically configure Notecard and send
Notes to [Notehub.io][notehub].

This library is used by the [note-arduino library][note-arduino], which includes it as a git submodule.

## Documentation
